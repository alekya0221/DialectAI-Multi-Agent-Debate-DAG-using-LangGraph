# DialectAI-Multi-Agent-Debate-DAG-using-LangGraph
A fully modular, LangGraph-powered system where two AI agents (Scientist vs. Philosopher) engage in an 8-round structured debate on a user-provided topic. The system features isolated memory views, strict turn validation, and an automated judging mechanism â€” all running from a clean CLI interface.
